#IMAGE PROCESSING
EXP1A :-Image Resizing
        Scaling operations increase or reduce the size of an image. 
EXP1B :-Image Rotation
        Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor. 
EXP1C :-Image Translation
        Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axis.
