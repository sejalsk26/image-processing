#IMAGE PROCESSING
EXP1A :-Image Resizing
        Scaling operations increase or reduce the size of an image. 
EXP1B :-Image Rotation
        Images can be rotated to any degree clockwise or otherwise. We just need to define rotation matrix listing rotation point, degree of rotation and the scaling factor. 
EXP1C :-Image Translation
        Translating an image means shifting it within a given frame of reference that can be along the x-axis and y-axis.
EXP1D:-Image shearing is a geometric transformation that skews an image along one or both axes i.e x or y axis.
EXP1E:-Image Normalization
       Image normalization is a process of scaling the pixel values in an image to a specific range.This is often done to improve the performance of image processing 
       algorithms, as many algorithms work better when the pixel values are within a certain range.
EXP1F:-Edge detection of Image
      The process of image edge detection involves detecting sharp edges in the image. This edge detection is essential in the context of image recognition or object 
       localization/detection. There are several algorithms for detecting edges due to its wide applicability.
EXP1G:-Image Blurring
       Image blurring is the technique of reducing the detail of an image by averaging the pixel values in the neighborhood. This can be done to reduce noise, soften edges, or 
        make it harder to identify a picture.
EXP1H :- Morphological Image Processing
        Morphological image processing is a set of python image processing techniques based on the geometry of objects in an image. These procedures are commonly used to 
        eliminate noise, separate objects, and detect edges in images.
